# Sovrin Network Transaction Visualisation PoC

This project visualises sovrin MainNet transactions, focusing on the heirarchical relationships that can be extracted from the connection between NYM, CLAIM_DEF and SCHEMA transactions. Specifically if you focus on all transactions linked to a specific schema.

This uses [IndyScan]("https://indyscan.io"), with the transactions being visualised initially fetched using the []IndyScan Api Client](https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan/tree/master/indyscan-api-client).
